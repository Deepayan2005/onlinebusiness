                <p class="answer">
                    Affiliate marketing is a process where publishers earn a commission by using an affiliate link to promote a product or service made by another retailer or advertiser. The affiliate partner is rewarded a payout for providing a specific result to the retailer or advertiser.

                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                    You don't own the products you're promoting. You simply join their affiliate program, grab your link, and post it on your page or website. It's perfect when you're starting out, because you don't have to invest a bunch of money into physical or digital products off the bat.
